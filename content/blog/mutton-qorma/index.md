# Preparation

Peel and slice 4 onions (medium). Fry till golden brown but don't overdo. Remove nearly all.

Put in meat and stir till dry. Add 2-3 small elaichi, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves. Add garlic first then ginger, all on medium flame. Then add salt.

Grind fried onions with at least 200g dahi and add to meat until oil surfaces. Then add chiles, bhuna dhaniya and zeera.

Now home made garam masala but not too much!

Add sufficient water and pressure cook till done.
