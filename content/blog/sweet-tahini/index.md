Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients:

* 1 cup white sesame
* 4-5 tablespoons of water
* 3-4 tablespoons grated jaggery OR dark muscovado brown sugar OR maple syrup OR honey OR agave nectar OR coconut sugar

# Directions

Roast sesame over low heat till nearly light brown in colour. The aroma will also tell you that itâ€™s ready. Do not over roast. Let cool. 

Put sesame in food processor with as much sweetening ingredient as you wish. Everyone has a different preference. Add water, and blend. 

Taste a little and check sweetness. Check the spreading consistency as well. Add more water if necessary. Enjoy!
