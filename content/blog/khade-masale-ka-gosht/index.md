### Khusbu ka Masala
- 4 whole green cardamon (_choti elaichi_)

# Process
In a heavy bottom pan put oil and let it burn by adding 1 whole red chilly, once the smoke comes out, remove from the burner and put aside for 30 – 45 secs, let it cool down a bit.

Put all Khushbu masala - adrak, lehsun, lal mirch, dhania Namak and then half of the Onions, get a rich brown colour of your masala.

Then put in Mutton and the rest of the onions. Keep stirring (bhuna). You can sprinkle water from time to time.

Once all masalas settle down then cover and cook on medium flame, put little bit of water (required). Keep checking and stirring to avoid masala getting stuck to the bottom of the pan.

Once the Mutton is nearly done just add the sqeezed lemon juice and cover, cook till desired softness of the mutton.
