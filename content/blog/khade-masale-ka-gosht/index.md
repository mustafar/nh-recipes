# Ingredients 
* 500g meat (mutton or goat)
* 500g onion, finely chopped
* 10g ginger (_adrak_), finely chopped
* 20 cloves garlic (_lehsun_), coarsely chopped
* 4 red chiles (_lal mirch_), coarsely cut
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds (_dhania_), roasted & coarsely ground
* 100g mustard oil (_sarson ka tel_) or any other oil, ghee or butter
* ½ tbsp lemon juice
* salt, to taste

### Khusbu ka Masala
* 4 whole green cardamon (_choti elaichi_)
* 4 whole cloves (_laung_)
* a pinch of nutmeg (_jaifal_)
* a small piece of cinnamon (_dalchini_)

# Directions
In a heavy bottom pan put oil and let it burn by adding 1 whole red chile. Once the smoke comes out, remove from the burner and put aside for 30 – 45 secs. Let it cool down a bit.

Put all Khushbu masala * adrak, lehsun, lal mirch, dhania, namak and then half of the onions until you get a rich brown colour of your masala.

Then put in meat and the rest of the onions. Keep stirring (bhuna). You can sprinkle water from time to time.

Once all masalas settle down then cover and cook on medium flame; put a little bit of water (required). Keep checking and stirring to avoid masala getting stuck to the bottom of the pan.

Once the mutton is nearly done, just add the squeezed lemon juice and cover ; cook till you reach the desired softness of the meat.

# Tips
> The lesser the water, the better the masala turns out.

> Sarson ka tel gives that additional zing.

> Heavy bottomed slow cooking enhances the dish.

> Last 2-3 minutes of cooking in pan / pressure cooker (without pressure) should be done on slow to medium fire to get the required oil on top – NEVER COOK With out cover.

> Cook in a pressure cooker if required. Put pressure valve after mixing the meat & second half of onions  

> Again, use as little water as required.
