# Preparation

### Rice
Wash and soak the rice. Boil 3 liters water. Add all khada (whole) garam masala to the water with 1 tsp oil and salt. Add soaked rice to boiling water and cook on high flame till rice is 80% done. Strain and keep aside.

### Yakhni
In a pressure cooker put mutton, ginger garlic paste, salt and red chile powder. Make a potli with muslin cloth with all the garam masala and put it inside the pressure cooker. Add water equivalent to half the quantity of mutton. Close lid and cook mutton till 90% done. It takes around 20 min for fresh mutton.

Once done remove the mutton from yakhni and keep aside.

### Pulao

Take a large vessel and add milk with all the powder spices, ½ fried onions, kewra water, rose water, saffron and cook on high flame.

Once the milk comes to a boil add the cooked mutton, yakhni and 2 tbsp ghee. Cook on high flame till the milk and yakhni mix together and the water dries up. Once mutton is cooked, put a layer of rice, remaining fried onion, food colour, 2 tsp ghee and kewra.

Seal the vessel with aluminum foil and the lid over it. Cook on low flame for 15-20 minutes.
