# Ingredients

* 1kg mutton leg (_raan_)
* 200g onions
* 4 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
* 150g yogurt
* 4 cloves
* 2-3 green cardamon pods (_elaichi_)
* 1 black cardamon pod (_badi elaichi_)
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds (_dhania_)
* 3 inch piece of dry coconut
* 8-10 cashews
* 1 tbsp peanuts
* 1 tbsp poppy seeds
* 2-3 dry red chiles, or to taste
* Coal, to smoke
* Raw papaya or any another tenderiser 
* 1½ cup oil or Ghee

### Preparation
Clean the mutton leg and remove the extra fat. Poke it well with fork or knife. Then marinate with raw papaya and salt. Let it rest for 6-8 hours.

Finely chop the onions. Fry ⅓ of them keep aside. Grind another ⅓ into a fine paste. Save the remaining for later.

Dry roast poppy seeds, coconut and cashews. Grind it into a fine paste with the fried onions.

Dry roast all the spices and grind.

# Directions
Heat oil in a large pan preferably mahi tawa so that entire leg fits in. Add oil and fry the remaining ⅓ raw chopped onions till golden brown.

Add the leg and cook till it releases water. Once the leg changes its colour add ginger garlic paste and cook for 10 mins.

Add the yogurt and spices. Allow it to cook for a while with closed lid.

Once leg is 90% done add the masala paste prepared earlier. Check salt and add more if needed.

Smoke right before serving.

# Tips
> Keep on turning the leg carefully in intervals.

> If the raan is too heavy raan it will be hard to cook, so pick an appropriately sized piece.

> Keep on putting oil and masala from the pan on the raan in intervals if it is hard to turn.
