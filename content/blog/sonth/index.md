Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 150 grams tamarind paste (seedless)ready to use OR 200 grams tamarind with seeds OR 150 grams dry mango powder (amchur)
* 300 grams good quality jaggery (organic preferred) OR dark muscovado brown sugar
* 650 ml water
* 1 teaspoon red chilli powder 
* 1 teaspoon ginger powder (sonth)
* 1 teaspoon roasted ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon fresh garam masala
* 3 teaspoons Himalayan salt


# Directions 

If using tamarind with seeds, run under water to remove any dirt, put in a small bowl, and soak in 1 1/2 cups boiling water, covered, for 45 minutes. Mash by hand, and taking water from the 650 ml as much as needed, pass through a sieve to get tamarind pulp, remembering to scrape the bottom of the sieve as you go. Check to see that no fibre is in the pulp. It should be smooth. Use this pulp and remaining water of 650 ml to proceed.

If using tamarind paste, put the paste, or if using dry mango powder, put the powder up to boil with 650 ml water along with remaining ingredients. Keep stirring on medium high till all the sugar or jaggery has dissolved.

Simmer with lid off, and stir occasionally. When it starts to thicken, take a little and put in a small bowl and let cool. See if you have the desired consistency. If too thin, cook for longer until it is the way you want. Do not remove the fenugreek seeds. You may adjust the spices if necessary. 

This chutney tastes better on ageing. I make extra and keep it in the fridge for a year. It needs to be refrigerated. If ever it gets too thick, you may boil a little water and add it. Enjoy!
