Servings: 5-6

# Ingredients
* 6 big eggs
* 500g finely chopped onions
* 1½ tbsp ginger-garlic paste
* 3 tbsp fresh coriander (_dhania_) powder
* 1 slit green chilli (optional)
* 4 tbsp well beaten yogurt
* 1 tsp garam masala
* A very small pinch of cinnamon (optional)
* 3 tbsp oil for scrambling eggs
* 3 tbsp oil for frying ingredients for the sauce (masala)
* Hot water to fry masala
* Red chilli powder, to taste
* Salt, to taste
* 2 tbsp chopped coriander for garnishing 

# Directions

Beat eggs with a pinch of salt.

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil, and scramble eggs, stirring very briskly. Take out with slotted spoon once the puffs are light brown. Keep aside on paper towel.

Fry onions till light brown, and keep aside.

Heat oil in a separate pan, and fry ginger-garlic paste, one green chilli. You may add 1 or 2 tablespoons of hot water to prevent burning. Keep heat on low heat. Continue till raw odour of ginger-garlic goes away.

Add red chilli, coriander powder, and salt, and keep frying using water when necessary till oil separates.

Now add eggs and fried onions, and pressure cook. After three whistles on high, reduce heat, and keep on low. Shake the pressure cooker so masala doesn't burn. Total time 15 minutes. Turn off stove after one last shake. Let cool.

Open lid, and add whipped yogurt and garam masala, and cinnamon powder (optional), and cook on slow for 5 minutes more. Turn stove off.

Garnish with green coriander. Serve with hot rotis, bread or plain rice.
