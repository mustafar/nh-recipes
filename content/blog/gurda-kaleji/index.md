# Ingredients
* Goat Liver and kidney- Half kilo in pieces   
* 4 tsp garlic paste
* 2 tsp ginger paste
* 2 medium onions
* 2 tsp cumin (_zeera_) powder, roasted
* 1 tsp turmeric (_haldi_) powder
* 1½ tsp coriander seed (_dhania_) powder
* 1 tsp garam gasala
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 large black cardamom pod (_badi elaichi_)
* 2 bay leaves (_tez patta_)
* 20g coriander leaves (_dhania ki patti_), chopped
* Salt, to taste
* 200g yogurt
* ½ tsp red chile (_lal mirch_) powder
* ⅓ cup oil

# Directions
Wash the liver and kidney pieces well with at least three rounds of water. Drain well and then mix in 1 tsp cumin pwd and 1 tsp garlic. Set aside for 15-20 minutes.

Now finally wash once again. The cumin and garlic should have completely removed the raw smell of the meat. Drain well after washing.

Chop the onions. Heat the oil in a 5 liter pressure cooker. Once it is warm enough add the sliced onions and sauté to a golden brown. Add the meat and sauté till dry.

Now add the remainder of the garlic paste and ginger. Add the cinnamon stick, large cardamom and bay leaves. When the oil separates add salt, chile powder, turmeric, roasted coriander and cumin powder, and garam masala. Then add the yogurt and continue to sauté.

When the oil separates add some water and pressure cook for about 12-15 minutes. The curry should be thickish. 

Garnish with green coriander leaves.
