# Ingredients

- Curd = 1 kg (a mix of thick curd n buttermilk would be very apt. Otherwise normal curd slightly tangy)
- Besan (gram flour) = 250 gms. 
(Makes about 35=40 small phulki)
### To add to curd -
- Garlic n zeera paste - 2 tbsp 
- Red Chilli powder = 1 TSP
- Salt to taste
- Roasted zeera powder - 1 TSP
### To add to PHULKI batter -
- Red Chilli powder - 1 tsp
- Salt - just a pinch
- Zeera powder -1 tsp
- Oil for frying

### For Tempering -
Rai, zeera n saboot redchilli nicely tempered in mustard oil

# Method

1. Make better of besan , n condiments listed. Should be beaten well with lots of air bubbles. Batter consistency should neither be runny nor too thick..  To test if batter is fine n well beaten - take a glass of water n add a drop of batter - if batter dissolves in water then it's not right; it's too runny/ if thick but stays at the bottom of the glass then consistency is right but you need to beat it more n incorporate more air in the batter/ if the drop rises in water....then it's ready to be fried.
2. In a kadhai or deep pan add enough oil to fry phulki's. 
3. Now drop with help of spoon or with your finger a few balls of besan in oil n deep fry till golden. Don't add too many at one times as then the phulki's won't be able to fry well. Also when you start frying, check that oil is hot, n when u start putting phulki's put flame on med high, otherwise outside of PHULKI will be fried but inside will be raw. Once you finish frying all. Keep them aside.
 4. Take curd in a big bowl or vessel. Beat it really well, it should again be pouring consistency but not runny. Add salt, rcp, roasted zeera n garlic & zeera paste. Taste n adjust seasoning (phulki has slightly rustic taste with the curd being tangy n chilly unlike dahi bada's wherein the curd is sweet n thick). Now take the PHULKI n put in a bowl of water n squeeze n add to the curd bowl. 
5. Temper the dahi PHULKI with zeera, rai n saboot red chilli fried in mustard oil. Ready to serve.
