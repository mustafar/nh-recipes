# Ingredients

* 500g dark pitted dates
* 250ml milk
* 1½ cups unsweetened desiccated coconut powder

# Preparation
Put milk up to boil in a karhai/wok. When it boils, reduce to a slow fire, add pitted dates, and cook continuously while mashing. Let all the milk be absorbed, and the dates mass becomes lumpy. 

Cool completely. Put desiccated coconut in a plate.

Smear a little butter on your palms, take some cooked dates and make laddoo size rounds (around 1½ inch). Smear more butter as you go along. Roll in coconut powder. These are soft laddoos.
