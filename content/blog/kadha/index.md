Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 4¼ cups water
* 1½ tsp cloves
* 1 tsp peppercorns
* 2” piece of cinnamon 
* 1” pounded ginger
* 1 fistful tulsi leaves OR 2 Organic India tulsi teabags 
* ½ tsp black tea
* 1 stalk lemongrass
* 2” pounded liquorice OR ½ tsp liquorice powder (_mulethi_)
* 1 or 2 tsp jaggery OR sugar
  * Alternatively, honey. If choosing honey, then add when drinking along with lemon juice

### For mixing later, when drinking
* 1 tsp lemon juice per cup
* 1 tsp honey (if you choose honey instead of sugar or jaggery)

# Directions

Put all ingredients up to boil except lemon juice (and honey if that is your preferred sweetener). When it reaches boiling point, reduce and simmer for 10 minutes. Switch off stove.

Let infuse for 30 minutes. Strain and reheat to drink hot like tea. Add lemon juice. Adjust sweetness. 

You will surely feel much relief if you can drink 1 litre in a day. 

Cheers to good health!
