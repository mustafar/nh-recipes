Servings: 4-5 tikiyas

# Ingredients
- 300g wheat flour 
  - Alternatively, use half all-purpose flour (_maida_) and half wheat flour (_aata_)
- 75g clarified butter (_desi ghee_)
- 100ml lukewarm full cream milk
- 100ml oil (optional)
- Salt, to taste (requires double salt than a usual roti/paratha)

# Directions
Sprinkle salt over the flour and mix desi ghee. Kneed it with fingers till the whole ghee is absorbed by the flour and it becomes crumbly.

Slowly add milk to knead flour. It is important NOT to add all the milk at once. Maybe 2 teaspoons at a time. Keep kneading with your knuckles till dough becomes a single lump. 

Invert a bowl over the dough and let rest for 10-15 minutes. Uncover the dough and knead for 2 minutes more.

Make 4-5 equal portions and roll them, without any extra flour, into a quarter inch thick rounds. The dough has enough ghee so it won't stick. The edges will split and that's the beauty of a roghini tikiya.

While rolling, turn the roti multiple times to ensure the thickness of roti is uniform. Thickness of roghni roti should be at least double (or even thrice) of the normal tava roti. Each tikiya should be pricked several times, using a fork on both sides to ensure that it gets cooked thoroughly, and that it doesn't puff up.

Pre-heat tawa/griddle on high first, and cook both the sides for 45 seconds on each side. Reduce flame to medium and then press the roti slowly and consistently. There are two options:
1. Use a  little oil on both sides.
2. Smear both sides with full cream milk for a richer flavour. 

Turn tikiya only once (with a broad flat turner) on one side else it may break. Make sure the edges are cooked well by gently pressing them also from time to time.

When done, keep tikiyas vertical and not on top of each other as in the picture, else they will get damp before you eat, even after 2 minutes.

Roghini tikiyas go best with:
- dry sliced potatoes (_qatle wale aloo_)
- ground meat and peas (_qeema matar_)
- shallow fried kababs (_shami kababs_)
- omelettes and scrambled eggs Indian style (_khageena_)
