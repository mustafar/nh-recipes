Difficulty: Hard

# Ingredients

### For the puffed bread (puri)
* 500g whole wheat flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp oil

### For the ground meat
* 500g ground meat
* 2 medium chopped onions
* 2 tbsp oil
* 1½ tsp ground ginger
* 1½ tsp garlic
* 1½ tsp salt
* 1 tbsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp red chile powder or to taste
* 1¼ tsp garam masala
* 2 tbsp yogurt
* hot water to fry the ground meat

# Directions

### Prepare the dough
Stir salt into flour well. Pour oil evenly over flour, and knead by adding a little water at a time so dough is neither too tight nor sticky. However, it should be such that you can push your thumb into it.

Cover and let rest for at least 30 minutes.

### Prepare the ground meat
Wash and drain ground meat very well, there should be no excess water.

Heat the oil in pressure cooker, and when warm, add chopped onions, fry till browned. Add ground meat, and cook on medium high till meat changes colour completely.

Add all spices along with ginger and garlic paste. Continue stirring and frying. If ground meat starts sticking, reduce heat to medium and add a tablespoon of hot water and continue this until the raw smell of ginger and garlic goes away completely.

Add yogurt and keep stirring without stopping else meat can burn. Finally add ½ cup water and cover cooker. Increase heat to medium high. After one whistle, reduce heat to low, and pick up cooker and give it a good shake. Repeat every five minutes. Cook for fifteen minutes then turn stove off. Let pressure drop. Open lid, and dry up any liquid left.

Take the ground meat out and leave any oil behind in cooker. Spread in a plate, and let cool completely.

### Make the puris
Break off same sized pieces of dough, say not more than 2" in size. Roll out using extra flour into 5" rounds.

Place approximately 1½-2 tablespoons cooled ground meat on one round, and spread evenly. Place second round(puri) on top, and stretch the bottom puri edges out by hand, and fold over top one, and then press to seal it. Continue doing this till all dough is used up.

Deep fry in hot oil till reddish brown on both sides. Drain on paper towel.

Serve with plain yogurt or raita.
