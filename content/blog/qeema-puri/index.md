3. Heat the oil in pressure cooker, and when warm, add chopped onions, fry till browned.
4. Add ground meat, and cook on medium high till meat changes colour completely.
5. Add all spices along with ginger and garlic paste. Continue stirring and frying.
6. If ground meat starts sticking. reduce heat to medium, and add a tablespoon of hot water, and continue this till raw smell of ginger and garlic goes away completely.
7. Add yoghurt, and keep stirring without stopping else meat can burn.
8. Finally add 1/2 cup water, and cover cooker. Increase heat to medium high.

10. Cook for fifteen minutes. Turn stove off. Let pressure drop. Open lid, and dry up any liquid left.
11. Take ground meat out and leave any oil behind in cooker. Spread in a plate, and let cool completely.
