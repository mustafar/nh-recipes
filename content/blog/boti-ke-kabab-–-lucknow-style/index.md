# Ingredients 
- ½ Kg Boti – about 1 cms (with approx. 10 / 15 percent fat)

# Masala
- 3 Medium sized Onions - 
- 15 Kaju (soaked)
- 10 Badam (soaked and skin removed)
- 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
- 1 tsp red chilly powder
- 1 tsp garam masala (khushbu ka masala)
- ½ tsp shah zeera
- 1 tsp khada bhuna dhania 
- ¼ tsp choti elaichi (powder)
- 2 tbsp raw papaya (with Skin) paste. 
- 100 gms – bhuna chane ka besan 
- ½ cup – hung curd (dahi)
- 1 egg (whole)
- 150 ml mustard oil / desi ghee
- 5-6 green chilies (chopped – small)
- 1 tbsp of Dhania (freshly cut)
- Salt, to taste 

# For cooking
- 2-3 small cardamom 
- 2-3 cloves
- 2 tez patta
- 1 small stick of cinnamon 
- Grind together fried onions, kaju, badam, shah zeera, khada bhuna dhania 

# For Smoking 
- 2 Coal (small pieces)
- 3-4 cloves
- 1 tsp ghee



# Marinade
Mix all masalas + Paste made of the other ingredients + Boti + hung and beaten curd mix well rubbing the botis together.
Overnight – can be put in fridge – but taken out some time in advance and got till room temperature 
2 – 3 hrs – to be put in room temperature or even in a warm place (this brings up the tenderising effect of raw papaya) 
Before putting in the pan mix the masala well with hand and very little mater, mix really well rubbing the botis and masala with your palms. 


# Process
Heat a pan on medium flame. 
Add “for cooking masala” and the marinade. 
Cook for 10 – 15 mins open stirring regularly – (bhuno) well, make sure that your masala does not settle down at the bottom (besan – will stick to the bottom) 
Add the cut green chillies, dhania and Khushbu (itr / kewda) if used – should use a few drops of kewda because generally, you do not get Itr (khane wala) + water (just enough for boti galena
Leave on low flame with dhungar when the botis are tender 

> Secret:
Dhungar (Smoke) gives it the uniform taste/smell.
Use all khada / Bhuna masala for Khusbu

> Alternate:
If you are not sure of the use of tenderiser, you can always cook the botis up to 80 % in the pressure cooker and then follow the methods of boti kabab
