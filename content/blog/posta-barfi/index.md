Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 500g poppy seeds (_posta_)
* 500g sugar, plus 1 cup for syrup
* 500g khoya (or 2 liters full fat milk to make it)
* A little ghee for smearing on plate 
* 50g melon seeds (optional)

# Directions
Wash poppy seeds well. Turn over on a dry cotton cloth, and dry completely under a fan. Once dry, roast till they are medium dark and emit a nice aroma. Keep aside and let cool.

If khoya is not available, make it by reducing two liters of milk till only the solids (_khoya_) remain. 

Roast the khoya till it is light brown. Cool and keep aside.

If using melon seeds, lightly roast and cool. Mix both the khoya and poppyseeds, and ¾ of melon seeds as well. Save the rest for garnishing. 

Take 1 cup water and add sugar till it’s three thread consistency — when you lift your spoon, three threads should be visible. You may also check by dropping a tiny bit of syrup into a cup of water, and if a little ball forms, then it is ready.

Pat into a ghee smeared plate or thali. Sprinkle remaining melon seeds and gently press them down. When halfway cooled, make diamond/ square cuts on the barfi.
