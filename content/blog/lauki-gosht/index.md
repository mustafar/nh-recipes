# Ingredients

* 500 gms of mutton
* 1 kg of bottle gourd (lauki), peeled, de-seeded and diced
* 12 large cloves of garlic
* 2 inches of ginger
* 2 large onions
* 1 teaspoon cumin (_zeera_) powder
* 2 teaspoons coriander powder (_dhania powder_)
* 1 teaspoon turmeric (_haldi_) powder
* 1½ teaspoon red chile (_lal mirch_) powder
* 2-3 cloves (_laung_)
* 2-3 green cardamom pods (_elaichi_)
* 1½ inches of cinnamon (_dalchini_)
* ⅔ cup mustard oil, or some neutral oil
* Hot water to help fry the spices
* 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves for garnishing
* Salt, to taste

# Directions

Wet grind with a little water one onion, garlic, and ginger. Keep aside.

In a pressure cooker heat the mustard oil till it starts to smoke then add to it one sliced onion, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon. Once the onion turns golden brown, add the meat and cook till it changes colour. It will take 10-15 minutes approximately.

Next add the ground onion, garlic, and ginger paste kept aside, and the rest of the spices. Continue cooking by adding two tablespoons of hot water till the raw smell of the masala goes and the oil starts to float on top.

Finally add the diced lauki and salt. Mix well. Add 1½-2 cups of water. After the first whistle, reduce heat and cook for approximately 15 minutes, or till meat is tender. Turn off stove, and let pressure drop completely.
Open the lid, and cook till excess water evaporates on high flame. Gently mash the pieces of bottle gourd with the back of a spoon. You should be left with a thick gravy.

Serve with chapatis.
