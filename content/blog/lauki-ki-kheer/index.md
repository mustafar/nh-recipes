# Ingredients
* 1 kg bottle gourd (_lauki_)
* 750g sugar
* 3 liters whole milk
* Â¼ tsp kewra

# Directions
Boil the milk in a heavy bottom pot and leave it on low heat. Stir occasionally till the milk thickens.

Wash and peel the lauki. Grate and boil it till it softens. Strain and keep it aside.

When the milk is thick and slightly pink, add strained lauki. Mix it well. Keep stirring till it thickens completely. Add sugar and stir till all the water evaporates and the consistency of the kheer is really thick. To test, take a spoon full of kheer and pour it on a plate. It should not be runny.

Turn of the heat. Add kewra and cover it for a few minutes. Let it cool.
