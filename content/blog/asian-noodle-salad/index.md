# Ingredients

* 2 packets of ramen (I use the oriental flavor, but whichever you want to use is fine!)
* 1 packet of dry Cole slaw (I used the dole kind) 
* ⅓ cup oil of your choice (vegetable oil is best) 
* ⅓ cup sugar 
* ¼ cup vinegar 
* 1 packet of sliced almonds 
* 1 packet of seasoned sunflower kernels
* ½ green onions chopped 

# Directions

Take both packets of ramen and crushed the noodles inside without opening the packet (use fist or back of cooking spoon) 

Take a bowl, pour the crushed ramen noodles (raw) into the bowl. Add sugar, oil, vinegar and  two packets of ramen noodle seasoning (found in packets of ramen) and mix with noodles.

Wrap noodles with cling wrap, and leave it in fridge to marinate for two hours. After two hours, take noodles out, mix with packet of dry Cole slaw (shredded cabbage mixed with purple cabbage and carrots).

Add almonds, sunflower kernels and green onions. Add one more tbsp of oil to finish it off!
