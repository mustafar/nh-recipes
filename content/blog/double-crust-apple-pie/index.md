Difficulty: Medium  

# Ingredients

### For the filling
* 6 cups tart apples, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 cup castor sugar
* 2 tsp fresh ground cinnamon
* ¼ tsp fresh ground/finely grated nutmeg
* 1 tbsp butter cut into small pieces
* 1 tbsp lemon juice only if apples lack tartness

## For the double crust
* 2½ cups all purpose flour
* 1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into ½“ cubes
  * Alternatively, ⅔ cup plus 3 tbsp shortening like Crisco, chilled and cut into ½" cubes.
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 6-8 tbsp ice-cold water

### For brushing on crust
* 1 tbsp castor sugar

# Directions
First make the double crust by mixing flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter (or shortening) by hand and rub in very well. 

Add cold water a tablespoon at a time until all flour is moistened. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons extra only if necessary. Form into a ball, and then divide into two.

Invert your 9" pie dish, and roll out the crusts so they are 2" bigger in diameter than the dish. If using shortening, then place both rolled crusts separately in the fridge for about 40-45 minutes which helps the pastry to become more flaky.

Turn dish right side up, fold pastry into fourths gently, and centre in the dish.

To prepare the filling, mix flour, salt, sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. Stir in apples(and lemon juice now only if they lack tartness), and coat well. Spoon into dish, and dot with cut pieces of butter.

Cover with top pastry. Make slits to let steam escape. Seal edges. Either make a pattern on the edge using a fork, or then flute the edges.

Cover edges with foil to prevent over browning, and remove 15 minutes prior to end of baking time.

Brush crust top with about 2 teaspoons of water, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of castor sugar evenly.

Bake for 40-50 minutes till the crust is golden, and juice begins to bubble through crust slits. Remove and cool for approximately 2 hours.

Enjoy with cheese!
