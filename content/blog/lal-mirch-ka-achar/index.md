Recipe Credit: Sultana Khala  
Difficulty: Easy  

# Ingredients
* 1kg firm red chile (_lal mirch, moti achar wali_)
* 100g cumin (_zeera_)
* 100g fennel seeds (_moti saunf_)
* 250g dry mango powder (_khatai_)
* 30g onion seeds (_kalonji_)
* 30g fenugreek seeds (_methi dana_)
* 3-4 tbsp salt, or to taste
* Mustard oil, enough to cover the chiles after they are filled and lined up in the achari or vessel.
* Muslin cloth to cover the achari for a couple of weeks.

# Preparation
Wash and dry the chiles well. Cut the tops off and reserve. Scoop out the seeds and keep aside.

Roast the zeera lightly till the aroma wafts in the air. Do the same and separately with saunf, kalonji, and methi. Cool, then grind together till coarse.

Add khatai and salt, and the amount of seeds you can tolerate. Taste again. Add just enough oil to bind the spices.

Fill the chiles with the masala using the back of a clean knitting needle, and pack well. Put the lids back on, and place chiles in the vessel so the lids are on top. Once all are done, gently pour oil over the chiles till all are just covered.

Tie the muslin over the top of the jar, and put in the sun. I have used a heater during the sunless winter days, and it has worked. After a couple of weeks, remove the muslin and put the lid on. 

# Tips
> This achar is best consumed within a couple of months of making. It doesnâ€™t keep like mango pickle.
