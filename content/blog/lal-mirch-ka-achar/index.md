DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY- EASY

\
**INGREDIENTS** 

1 kilo firm lal mirch(moti achar wali)

100 grams zeera(cumin)

100 grams moti saunf(anise)

250 grams khatai(dry mango powder)

30 grams kalonji(nigella)

30 grams methi dana(fenugreek seeds)

salt about 3-4 tablespoons(taste and see)

Mustard oil enough to cover the chillies after they are filled and lined up in the achari or vessel.

A muslin cloth to cover the achari for a couple of weeks.



**METHOD**



Wash and dry the chillies well. Cut the tops off and reserve.

Scoop out the seeds and keep aside.

Roast the zeera lightly till the aroma wafts in the air. Do the same and separately with saunf, kalonji, and methi.

Cool, then grind together till coarse.

Add amchur and salt, and the amount of seeds you can tolerate. Taste again.

Add just enough oil to bind the spices.

Fill the chillies with the masala using the back of a clean knitting needle, and pack well.

Put the chilly lids back on, and place chillies in the vessel so the lids are on top.

Once all are done, gently pour oil over the chillies till all are just covered. Tie the muslin over the top of the jar, and put in the sun. I have used a heater during the sunless winter days, and it has worked. After a couple of weeks, remove the muslin and put the lid on. This achar is best consumed within a couple of months of making. It doesnâ€™t keep like mango pickle.
