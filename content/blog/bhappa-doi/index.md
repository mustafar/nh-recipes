Difficulty: Easy  

## Ingredients
* 800g yogurt (_dahi_, 2 containers)
* 1 tin condensed milk

## Preparation

### Hung yogurt
The recipe calls for yogurt that has been hung (made into yoghurt cheese). During Indian summers, hang in the fridge for 6-8 hours. You can put muslin in a sieve over a bowl to collect the water.

Whip the yoghurt. Mix in the condensed milk well. Pour into a ovenproof dish, the taller the better.

Place dish into a pressure cooker with about 2-2.5 inches of boiling water. Put the cooker lid on __without the whistle__, for exactly 20 mins . 

Carefully remove, and very gently pour any water you see on top (it will be there for sure). Cool completely and refrigerate till chilled. It cuts well once fully chilled.

# Tips
> You may add ground cardamom and saffron for a desi taste, or vanilla if you like. I make it plain. 

> Once cool, you may whip it gently and make bhaapa doi cheesecake or then use it as a base for umpteen types of desserts.
