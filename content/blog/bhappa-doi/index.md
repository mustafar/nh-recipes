(STEAMED SWEETENED YOGURT)

For: 6-8 PERSONS

DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY- VERY EASY\

 **Ingredients**:

* 800 grams yoghurt(India 2 dibbas)that has to be hung(made into yoghurt cheese)In Indian summers hang in the fridge for 6-8 hours. You can put muslin in a sieve over a bowl to collect the water.
* 1 tin condensed milk

  **Method** 

 Whip the yoghurt

Mix in the condensed milk well.

 Pour into a ovenproof dish, the taller the better.

 Place dish into a pressure cooker with about 2-2.5 inches of boiling water.

 Put the cooker lid on WITHOUT THE WHISTLE, for exactly 20 mins  

Carefully remove, and very gently pour any water you see on top(it will be there for sure).

 Cool completely and refrigerate till chilled. It cuts well once fully chilled.

 Note: you may add ground cardamom and saffron for a desi taste, else add vanilla if you like. I make it plain. Once cool, you may whip it gently and make bhaapa doi cheesecake or then use it as a base for umpteen types of desserts.
