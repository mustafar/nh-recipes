# Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup of vinegar 
* 1 packet of sliced almonds

2. Take a bowl, pour the crushed ramen noodles (raw) into the bowl. 
3. Add sugar, mix with noodles. Add oil, mix with noodles. Add vinegar, mix with noodles. Add two packets of ramen noodle seasoning (found in packets of ramen), mix with noodles.
