# Directions
Marinate the chicken in all of the marinade ingredients. Let it rest for atleast an hour. For best results let it sit overnight in the fridge.

Heat mustard oil and add marinated chicken. Mix it well till chicken seals. Cover and cook on low flame. Do not add any extra water. If there is water even after chicken is cooked, let it cook some more until it is dry.

Now put chicken pieces on a gas grill and grill until you get the marks on them.

Next, heat some oil and add ginger-garlic paste, onion and tomato paste and all powdered spices. Bhuno till oil separates.

Add cashew paste and yogurt. Mix well. Add any masala left in pan in which chicken was cooked. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Then add cream and mix on medium flame. 

Now add the grilled chicken and lemon juice. Add about ½ cup water and cook covered on low flame for about 5 minutes.

Place hot coal in a steel katori inside the pan, add ghee on coal and cover for a few minutes. 

Remove coal, garnish with coriander and serve with naan.
