# Directions

Wash vegetables and herbs if using fresh ones, then drain. 

Finely chop tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger. Keep aside, and do not mix them.

Chop spinach, and herbs-fenugreek and dill if using fresh.

Dice green pepper into 1" pieces. 

Peel and dice eggplant and potatoes into 1" cubes, and cauliflower into 1" pieces as well. 

If using mustard oil, smoke and cool till warm.

Over low flame, add mustard seeds first, when they just begin browning, quickly add nigella and cumin. When cumin splutters quickly add onions, and increase heat to medium. After two minutes, add ginger and garlic, and reduce heat to low again. When onions are a nice golden colour, increase flame to medium, add tomatoes and all spices, and keep frying by adding 1-2 tablespoons hot water, till oil fully separates, and floats on top.

Now add all vegetables and herbs, give a good stir. DO NOT add any water, the vegetables contain enough. Increase heat to high without lid for five minutes while stirring continuously. Reduce to medium for ten minutes, stirring all the time, then finally on low, and cover with lid. Give a stir once in a while. When potatoes are 3/4 done, remove lid, and cook till all water is dried up. Enjoy the aromas! Serve with garlic-chilli chutney, and roti made from gram flour(besani/missi roti).
