# Ingredients
* ½ kg mutton
* ¾ th cup of mustard oil
* 2 medium sized onions sliced
* 2 whole dried red chillies
* 2½ tsp turmeric (1½ to be used in the mutton and 1 tsp to be used in the daal)
* Juice of ½ lemon
* 1 tbsp ginger paste
* 1 tbsp garlic paste 
* 1 tsp red chilli powder
* 2 tsp coriander (_dhania_) powder
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp Lazzat-e-taam (pre made mixture), optional
* Few roughly chopped mint leaves (_pudina_)
* 2-3 slit green chillies
* 1 tbsp desi ghee
* 400 gms of split chickpea (chana daal), soaked for 2-3 hrs
* Salt, to taste

# Directions 
Boil the soaked chana daal with salt and 1 tsp of turmeric powder in 3 cups of water in a pressure cooker. After the first whistle, cook the daal for 5-7 mins on low heat. Keep Aside.

Separately in a pressure cooker heat ¾ cup of mustard oil. When it comes to boiling point add onions and the dried whole red chillies.

Once the onion is brown, add the meat and stir till the water evaporates. Next add 1½ tsp of turmeric powder and lemon juice and cook for another 2-3 mins.

Add the ginger garlic paste, keep stirring for another 2-3 mins. 

Next add the red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala, lazzat-e-taam and salt. Cook for a few mins. Add half a cup of water and cook on low flame for 12-15 mins after the first whistle (depending on the texture of the meat).

Once the meat is cooked, mix it with the daal. Adjust consistency as needed. Add the roughly chopped mint leaves and slit green chillies and give it another boil.

Before serving add desi ghee. Enjoy!
