# Ingredients
* 2 lbs of shrimp, cleaned and with tails cut off
* 1½ inch piece of ginger
* 1 whole pod of garlic
* 1 onion
* 2-4 green chilies
* 6 tomatoes for gravy
* 1½ tsp of turmeric
* Salt, to taste
* 4 tbsp oil

# Directions

Pour the oil in a pan. Once warm saute the garlic, ginger, and green chili paste. Once it is light brown in colour and you get a good fragrance, add the onions — they can be chopped or made into a paste.

Add salt and turmeric. Once all these ingredients are sauteed add the blended or finely chopped tomatoes to make a reasonable amount of gravy.

The last thing you add is shrimp. Cook for 5 minutes, not more otherwise it becomes tough and chewy. Sprinkle finely cut green coriander over the curry. Serve with rice.
