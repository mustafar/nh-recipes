# Ingredients

## For the custard

* 2 cans condensed milk
* 4 cups whole milk
* 4 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

## For the caramel

* 1/2 cup sugar
* 5 tbsp water 

# Directions

Put custard ingredients in a bowl and beat till frothy.

The caramel part is a little tricky. Put sugar in a heavy bottom pan with water, and cook on high heat. There may be smoke coming out of the pan. 

Now is the time to pay attention.  Let the caramel boil until is gets dark brown and is still in a liquid state. 

Quickly pour into a heatproof glass dish. It will harden very quickly.

If it doesn't spread evenly, do not worry, it will sort itself out. 

Now pour the custard mixture into the bowl with the caramel.

Get a large pan for steaming the custard like a roasting pan, and put the glass bowl in. Fill water halfway up the glass bowl, and cook in oven for an hour. 

In 45 minutes check as each oven is different. Your knife should come out clean. 

Remove from oven, and from roasting pan. Cool completely, and put in fridge till it sets. 

To remove, turn a knife all the way around gently, and put a dish on top of bowl, and turn upside carefully. Your creme caramel is ready! Enjoy!

# Story
> In our home it was our father who made creme caramel, surprising but true, and oh so good! Once our cousin came for dinner and found it quite tasty, 
and was eyeing the remaining for another piece. We were so involved in conversation that we forgot to ask him whether he would like another piece. 
Our cultural upbringing was such that we didn’t ask for seconds, rather we waited for someone to insist that we absolutely have another piece. 
Finally, unable to control any longer, our cousin took an embarrassed look at the creme caramel which was cut at 8:00 by now, and said, 
“I think I’ll straighten the line.” We all started laughing, and then he laughed too!
