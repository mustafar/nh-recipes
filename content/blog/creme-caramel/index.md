# Ingredients

### For the custard
* 2 cans condensed milk
* 4 cups whole milk
* 4 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

### For the caramel
* ½ cup sugar

# Directions
Preheat oven to 240F. Spray ovenproof dish and keep aside.

Over medium heat, put ½ cup sugar in a small, heavy base saucepan. In the beginning, you will not see any change, but soon sugar will start melting around the edges. Do not use spoon or utensil, rather keep swirling sugar around continuously (using saucepan handle) until all sugar melts. When all has melted, and turned dark brown, quickly pour into dish which has been sprayed since it will harden right away. 

If it doesn't spread evenly, do not worry, it will sort itself out. 

Now pour the custard mixture into the bowl with the caramel.

Get a large pan (like a roasting pan) for steaming the custard, and put the glass bowl in. Fill water halfway up the glass bowl, and cook in oven for an hour. 

In 45 minutes check as each oven is different. If your knife comes out clean, remove, else, bake till full hour is complete. 

Remove from oven, and from roasting pan. Cool completely, and then put in fridge till it sets. 

To remove, turn a knife all the way around gently, and put a dish on top of bowl, and invert very carefully. Your creme caramel is ready! Enjoy!

# Story
> In our home it was our father who made creme caramel, surprising but true, and oh so good! Once our cousin came for dinner and found it quite tasty, and was eyeing the remaining for another piece. We were so involved in conversation that we forgot to ask him whether he would like another piece. Our cultural upbringing was such that we didn’t ask for seconds, rather we waited for someone to insist that we absolutely have another piece. Finally, unable to control any longer, our cousin took an embarrassed look at the creme caramel which was cut at 8:00 by now, and said, “I think I’ll straighten the line.” We all started laughing, and then he laughed too!
