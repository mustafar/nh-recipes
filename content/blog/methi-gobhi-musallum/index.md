# Ingredients

* 700 grams cauliflower 
* ⅛ tsp fenugreek seeds
* 100g finely chopped onions
* 6 cloves garlic
* 4 tsp coriander seeds
* ½ tsp red pepper powder
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1½ tsp salt plus 3/4 teaspoon salt 
* 100ml mustard oil or any neutral oil
* 20g root ginger
* 2 green chillies (optional garnishing)
* ½ tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)
* 400g tomatoes 
* 250ml hot water plus extra for cooking masala

# Directions

Wash cauliflower well, and let water drain. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons salt all over and keep  aside for 30 minutes. 

In the meantime grind onions, ginger, and garlic, and coriander seeds to a fine paste. 

Blanch tomatoes, peel, and chop roughly, and keep aside.  

Heat oil in a wok (karhai) on medium flame, and add fenugreek seeds. 

Quickly turn flame to slow, and just when seeds start turning only slightly brown(else they will turn bitter), add the onion, ginger, garlic, and coriander seed paste. 

Fry the masala along with dried fenugreek leaves, turmeric, red pepper, 3/4 teaspoon salt, while adding 2 tablespoons of hot water when necessary to avoid burning, till oil floats on top, and it becomes golden brown. The raw smell of the paste should disappear completely. 

Add chopped tomatoes till they blend with the masala well, and oil again floats on top.

Take half of this masala from the pan and keep aside. Add 250 ml hot water, and place cauliflower in the wok. Alternatively you cook bake it in an oven at 250 F for 30 minutes. If cooking in a wok keep flame at its lowest, and keep putting remaining masala on and in the cauliflower at intervals, and keep turning it gently from one side to the other. It should remain whole. Garnish with cut green chillies. 

Enjoy!
