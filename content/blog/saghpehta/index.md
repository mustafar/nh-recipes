# Ingredients
* 100g maash or urad daal (green variety with skin (_chilka_))             
* 100g bathua saaf or spinach (_palak_)
* 50g fresh dill (_soya_)
* 1 inch piece ginger
* 3 medium green thai chiles (_hari mirch_)

* ¼ tsp red chile (_lal mirch_) powder
* 1 medium onion
* 2 dry red chiles (_lal mirch_)
* ½ tsp cumin seeds (_zeera_)
* Pinch of asafoetida (_hing_)
* 2-3 tbsp ghee

# Directions
First clean and chop the bathua and soya. Remove all the thick stems. Wash and drain.

Wash the daal and put into a pressure cooker. Add the chopped and well drained greens. Add chopped ginger, green chile, salt, red chile powder. Add 2½ cups of water. Pressure cook for 10-12 minutes. On opening, stir well and adjust the thickness of the saghpehta. It should not be too thin.

Now prepare the seasoning. In a small fry pan warm the ghee and add the sliced onions. Once nearly brown add the whole red chile, cumin and asafoetida. Pour over the saghpehta and serve. It is eaten with plain rice.
