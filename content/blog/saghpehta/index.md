* 1 medium onion
* 2 dry red chiles (*lal mirch*)

# Directions

First clean and chop the bathua and soya. Remove all the thick stems. Wash and drain.

Wash the daal and put into a pressure cooker. Add the chopped and well drained greens. Add chopped ginger, green chile, salt, red chile powder. Add 2½ cups of water. Pressure cook for 10-12 minutes. On opening, stir well and adjust the thickness of the saghpehta. It should not be too thin.
