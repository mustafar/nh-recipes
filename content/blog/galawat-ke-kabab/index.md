Turn off the flame and grate the nutmeg in the pan, add in dry rose petals and mix well.
Let the spices cool down completely. Grind the spices to a fine powder.

### Kababs

In a mixing bowl combine minced meat, prepared spice mix, ginger garlic paste, raw papaya, kewra water, rose water, salt, Bhuna besan and mix well.

Make a shallow hole in the center of the mix put the Onion peel, put 1/2 burning small piece coal, pour over Desi ghee, leave covered for 2 – 3 minutes and then remove the Onion peel with coal, mix well the aroma in the mixture.

Let the meat marinade for minimum 2 hours or preferably overnight in refrigerator.
Take the meat out of refrigerator.

Now take a flat pan. Heat ghee on medium heat for shallow frying.

Wet your hands with water and take a portion of meat mixture and directly place on the pan while shaping them into patties.

Fry till golden crust is formed on both the sides and evenly cooked.
Remove the kababs on absorbent paper to remove the excess fat.

# Tips

> Dhungar (Smoke) gives it the uniform taste / smell.

> Use all khada / Bhuna masala for Khusbu.

> Sprinkle of Milk & Ghee makes the Kababs soft.

> Always remove your pan from the stove, keep aside for 1 minute and then turn the other side, kababs would never break.

> Never try to make a perfect tikki (patty), just role the keema in your wet hand and throw it on the pan.

> Just use 15 – 20% more papaya and you do not have to keep the masala away, just start frying.
