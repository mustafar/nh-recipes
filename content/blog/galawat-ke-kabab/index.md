# Tips

> Dhungar (Smoke) gives it the uniform taste / smell.

> Use all khada / bhuna masala for Khusbu.

> Sprinkle of milk & ghee makes the Kababs soft.

> Always remove your pan from the stove, keep aside for 1 minute and then turn the other side, kababs would never break.

> Never try to make a perfect tikki (patty), just role the keema in your wet hand and throw it on the pan.

> Just use 15 – 20% more papaya and you do not have to keep the masala away, just start frying.
