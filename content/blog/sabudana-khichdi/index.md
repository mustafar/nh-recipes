# Ingredients
* 440g or 2 cups tapioca pearls (_sabudana_), before soaking
* 450 ml or 2 cups water
* 2 tbsp oil
* 1 tsp cumin seeds (_zeera_)
* 3-4 curry leaves (_kari patta_)
* ½ tbsp grated ginger 
* 2 green thai chiles (_hari mirch_), finely chopped 
* 2 medium sized potatoes, peeled and cubed 
* 1 carrot chopped finely
* ½ cup green peas ( optional ) 
* ½ cup roasted peanuts 
* Salt, to taste 
* 1 tbsp lemon juice, or to taste
* Fistful of chopped cilantro (_dhania ki patti_), for garnishing

# Instructions
In a big, wide bowl soak sabudana by adding just enough water to cover them. Just 1/4 inch more     than sabudana level. Soak covered for 5-6 hours, preferably overnight. Sabudana will fluff up after soaking. Drain off excess water if any before cooking.

Add oil to a heavy bottom non stick pan. Once warm, add in the cumin seeds. Add in the cubed potatoes and cook on a low flame until tender, flipping occasionally.

Now add in the curry leaves, ginger, chopped chiles and cook for a minute more.

Once the potatoes are tender add chopped carrot and green peas to the pan. Sauté it for some time.

Now add sabudana to the pan, mix everything well and cook until the sabudana are a bit translucent and well coated.

Add lemon juice and mix well. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Garnish it with chopped cilantro and peanuts. Ready to serve!
