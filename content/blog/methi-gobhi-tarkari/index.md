Servings: 3-4
Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 475g cauliflower cut into very small pieces OR sliced thin ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons finely cut 
* 1 green chilli finely cut 
* ⅛ tsp fenugreek seeds 
* ¾ tbsp dried fenugreek leaves 
* ¼ tsp turmeric
* ¾ tsp salt or according to taste
* ½ tsp chilli powder 
* 1 tbsp mustard oil OR neutral oil
* 2-3 tbsp water
  * Note: if your cauliflower variety can cook without water, do not add any. 
* 1 tsp dry mango powder

# Directions 

Put fenugreek seeds in warm oil, and keep flame on low. Just when seeds start to turn brown, quickly add ginger, stir, and after 30 seconds add green chilli, keeping flame on low. 
Keep stirring and when ginger has lightly browned, add cauliflower, and the remaining spices, keeping flame low at all times. If choosing to use water, add now. Again, use the bare minimum amount. 

Cover and cook. Stir occasionally, after 7-8 minutes, remove lid and cook open. When half done, add dry mango powder, stir, and soon it will be ready.

A quick, super easy, and aromatic cauliflower dish that you can make quickly on a busy day, or if guests drop in. Enjoy!
