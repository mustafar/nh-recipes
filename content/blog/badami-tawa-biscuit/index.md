# Ingredients

* 1½ cups unsalted butter
* 1 cup castor sugar
* 2 egg yolks
* 2¾ cups flour
* 1 cup almond flour
* 1 cup soaked and peeled almond halves
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground cardamom (*elaichi*)
* 1 big pinch of saffron (*zafran*), crushed

# Preparation

Sift flours and salt. Whip butter and sugar till fluffy. Add egg yolks, ground cardamom and saffron. Gradually add flour. Mix well. 

Roll out into ½ inch thick and 3 inches diameter rounds. Press almonds on to biscuits. Place on tawa or frypan, better if dosa tawa, and cook till medium brown. Turn once, and cook the other side also. Edges may crack, it’s normal.

# Tips

> You can replace almond flour with cashew flour, and almond halves with cashews.
