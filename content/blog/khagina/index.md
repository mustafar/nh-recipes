# Ingredients
* 4 eggs
* 1-2 medium sized onions, finely chopped
* 1 medium sized tomato, finely chopped
* ½ tsp ted chilli powder or chopped whole red chilli (_kati lal mirch_)
* 1-2 green chillies, finely chopped
* 1 tsp chopped green coriander leaves
* 1 tbsp salt, or to taste
* 1½ tbsp refined oil

# Directions
Heat oil in a shallow pan and add green chillies and onions. Sauté a little bit. Then add tomatoes and sauté till the tomatoes break. Add red chillies and salt and mix. Then add eggs well beaten together and sauté, mixing and pressing them by rubbing to the vessel bottom.

Add in chopped coriander leaves, cover for a minute and serve.

Khagina is served best with [Roghni Tikiya](/roghni-tikiya), [Qatli Aaloo](/qatli-aaloo), [Shami Kabab](/shami-kabab) (or kaleji) for an exquisite Oudhi breakfast. To finish, have some fresh cream (_balai_) with tikiya.

# Tips
> After mixing the eggs, cover and cook on slow fire for 1-2 minutes. It leaves the khagina juicy.
