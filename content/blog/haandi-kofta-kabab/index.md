Now prepare the spices. Dry roast the coriander and cumin seed powder together and dry roast the poppy seeds separately. 
Peel the cardamoms and dry roast with cinnamon, peppercorns, cloves. Now finely grind the above along with poppy seeds. Dry roast the gram flour.

Now mix the spices, ginger and onion into the mince. Chop the green coriander and chilies. Mix in. Shape into medium kofta size balls.

Choose wide haandi with a heavy base. Pour in oil and slice two onions. Brown them. Reduce the flame to simmer and carefully place the meatballs one next to the other. Do not use a lid.

Once a crust has formed use a spatula to change sides. Continue to turn sides with patience till golden brown.
