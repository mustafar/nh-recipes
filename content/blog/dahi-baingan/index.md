Now remove the skin from around the slices. Mash with a spoon and add salt, chili and cumin powder. Now add the chopped onions and  greens.
Refrigerate till you are ready to serve.....Bring to room temperature and fold in the whisked yoghurt. Stir carefully
If the yoghurt is too thick whisk in 1- 2 tbsps of milk before adding to the eggplant
In a fry pan prepare the seasoning....some oil, a pinch of black mustard seeds, a few leaves of sweet neem and two dry red chilies.
Season the dish and enjoy it with multigrain / plain roti
