# Ingredients

* 2 kg black carrot (_kaali gajar_)
* 2 liters whole milk
* 1 cup sugar, or to taste
* 500g khoya
* 5 kg pure ghee
* 100g raisins
* 100g cashews
* Few strands of saffron (_zafran_)
* Silver leaf (_chandi ka varaq_)

# Preparation
Wash the carrots well and peel off the skin. Grate the carrots by hand or in a food processor.

Soak the saffron in a tbsp of warm milk and cover it. In a fry pan sautÃ© the khoya so that the rawness goes away.

In a pot with a heavy base boil the milk. Add the grated carrots. Boil and stir till the milk is nearly dry. Add the ghee, sugar, khoya and raisins. Add the saffron.

Remove from flame. Garnish with cashews and silver leaf.

# Tips
> Dark carrots can be replaced with orange ones.
