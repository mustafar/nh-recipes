Slice the onions thinly, and fry till golden brown. Remove, cool, and grind.

In the same hot oil, add garlic and ginger paste, ground onions, salt, spices, and yogurt.

When oil separates, add water and boil. 

When boiling point is reached, add koftas and cook for approximately 12 minutes in the rapidly boiling gravy, without the lid, then reduce to simmer, and let all oil surface completely. If a thicker gravy is desired, let cook longer. 

Turn off stove. Garnish with coriander.
