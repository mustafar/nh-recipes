# Ingredients:
* 1 kg chicken
* 20g yogurt
* 8-10 cashews
* 2 onions, ground to a fine paste
* 1 onion, chopped and fried
* 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
* 4 cloves (_laung_)
* 2 tsp red chile (_lal mirch_) powder
* 3 green cardamon pods (_elaichi_)
* 1 small piece cinnamon (_dalchini_)
* 1 tsp poppy seeds (_posta_),
* 3 inch piece of dried coconut
* ½ cup milk
* 1 drop sweet essence (_meetha itr_)
* Orange food colouring
* ½ tsp kewra
* 2 tbsp ghee
* Salt, to taste

# Directions
Lightly roast the dry coconut so that the color doesn't change. Add roasted cashews, coconut, fried onions and posta to a grinder and grind to a fine paste.

Heat ghee and add laung, elaichi, dalchini and chicken. Fry it well. Once chicken is cooked, add the onion paste. Then add ginger garlic paste. Add salt and red chile powder and cook for 10 minutes.

Add well beaten yogurt and cook till chicken is half done. Add ground masala and cook well. If chicken turns dry you can add milk instead of water.

Once chicken is done add meetha itr and kewra. Optionally add orange food colouring.

# Tips
> Use a heavy bottom vessel to cook. The gravy should be thick.

> Poppy seeds can be replaced with sesame seeds
