# Directions

Biryani will be made in two separate parts and assembled into a large baking tray and/or handi pot and put to steam. Assembly and directions are as follows.

### Rice
Set to boil a full pot of water with much more water than you have rice. Add 1 tbsp whole garam masala, 1 bay leaf, 1 sliced lemon, all cilantro stems only, 2-3 tbsp oil, and heavy salt.

Once boiled remove cilantro stems and other aromatics and add soaked rice and stir gently. Boil until rice starts to dance within the water and continually check the rice – ONLY HALF COOK THE RICE. 

Drain and keep aside.

### Meat
Combine boneless beef, haldi, red chile powder, 1 tbsp garam masala, 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, half of your green chiles, 1 full packet of Masaledar or 1 full packet of Karachi Beef/Sindhi Biryani Masala. Set aside overnight if possible, to marinate.

Pressure cook 20-30mins or until beef is tender, stir half way through ensure nothing is sticking to the pot. Lightly pour extra liquid released in the pot over the rice to keep moist and add flavor

### Masala
Fry all onions until golden brown in remainder oil and ghee — it must be golden, so be patient.

Add 1 tbsp whole garam masala, remainder of green chiles and stir until fried. Add remaining ginger-garlic and fry for 1-2mins. 

Add other packet of Masala (Masaledar Bombay / Shan Bombay) and all aloo bhukhara and stir until fried.

Add diced tomatoes and fry until oil separates. Ensure all spices and sauce is fried and well incorporates and simmer until tomatoes break down.

Add yogurt and stir, watch carefully make sure its combined into masala well, simmer for 2-3+ mins. Check for salt, flavor, etc. it should be salty and heavy on spice/flavor as it will combine with plain rice. Add masala to your beef and give one more whistle (2-5mins).

### Assembly
Take your biryani tray/pot and add some oil to the bottom — just a little. Spread a little bit of gravy/masala at the bottom. Add half of rice to make a layer.

Spread half of thinly sliced lemons and thinly lengthwise sliced chiles and cilantro. Next, add meat and masala in one layer, and the remaining rice in another.

Then spread lemons, mint, chiles, color, rose and kewra, and saffron nicely spread across the layer of rice. Cover with foil and bake in oven or stove as normal 350F for 30 mins. 

Remove, let rest, mix gently, and enjoy!

# Tips
> If you can not find the National biryani masala (keep trying its worth it!), use 1 packet Shan Bombay Biryani and 1 packet Karachi Beef/Sindhi Biryani masalas.
