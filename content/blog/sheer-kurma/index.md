DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE\
\
INGREDIENTS:\
\
5 litres full fat milk\
\
100 grams rice(any, I use basmati)soaked then ground till it feels grainy\
\
375 grams sugar\
\
125 grams roasted Benarsi sewaein\
\
fist full of unsalted pistachios, soaked and slivered\
\
fist full of unsalted almonds, soaked, peeled, and slivered\
\

\
Big pinch of saffron\
\
1 teaspoon ground cardamom\
\
I don't use kewra but you can, maybe 2 teaspoons taste and see\
\
METHOD\
\
Put up room temperature milk to boil along with ground rice, medium high to high heat with saffron and ground cardamom. Add more later if you think cardamom is not enough. Stir continuously till rice is cooked. You should be able to mush it with your fingers.\
\
Now add sugar, and keep stirring. Soon, the milk will start thickening. This is by experience that you get to know, but when you see the change, take out a spoon in a little bowl, and let cool. You will be able to judge it's consistency. Turn heat down to low.\
\
In a tablespoon of ghee, fry the sevaein on low to medium heat, being very attentive. When a nice aroma wafts through the air, be careful not to overdue it, quickly put it in the milk. Raise heat to medium, and let it cook till done, again, testing it between your fingers. Switch off stove.\
\
In a tablespoon of ghee, fry pistachios over low heat and when done, pour over sheer. Save some ghee for the almonds, and fry separately. Pour over sheer also.\
Both should be lightly fried, golden.\
