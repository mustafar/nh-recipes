# Method

For turai gosht, wash, peel and cut the gourd into thin round slices. Keep aside 
If you decide to cook kakri gosht, use  thick kakdi. Wash and cut into cubes. Keep aside.
Wash the mutton and drain well
Pour out the oil into a pressure cooker and when hot add the sliced onions. Saute and brown them. 
Add the mutton. Saute till it dries up.
Add the garlic and ginger paste and some water. 
Continue to saute till there is no raw smell. Add chopped tomatoes and allow them to cook till nearly dry. Add salt and all the spices. Saute some more till the oil surfaces.
Now add the turai. Add some water but not too much since the turai will release a lot of water. Pressure cook for 18-20 minutes. Check the water content and adjust. It should not be too dry. Garnish with green coriander.

For Kakdi Ghost...cook the same way as above till the oil surfaces. Then add water and pressure cook for 10 minutes. When the pressure is released add the kakri and kalauji. Adjust the water and pressure cook for another 10 minutes. On opening the cooker, adjust the water content.
Garnish with green coriander.
