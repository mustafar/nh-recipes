### Daal mix

* 2 cups of split urad daal
* 2 green chillies
* 1 inch ginger
* 2 tsps coriander seeds need to be ground in a fine powder and mixed into the batter

### Spice mixture

* 1 tsp of red chilli powder
* 2 tsps of black salt
* 2tsps of roasted cumin seeds ground
* Salt, to taste

### Yogurt mix

* 500 grams of yogurt beaten with a whisk.
* 1 tsp of sugar

# Directions

Make a nice batter with urad daal. Keep stirring the batter for 5-7 mins till soft and fluffy. Once the batter is done, make reasonably sized balls and deep fry to make vadas. Excess oil can be drained on a paper towel.

Once the vadas are made soak them in water for 5-7 mins. Squeeze out the excess water from them. Lay them on a plate and add beaten yogurt and tamarind chutney on top.

Sprinkle chaat masala over the vadas to your taste.
