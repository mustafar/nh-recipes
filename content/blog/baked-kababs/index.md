# Ingredients
* 1 kg ground mutton
* 1 kiwi ground with skin and seeds or 100 grams raw papaya with skin and 1 tsp salt
* 1½ tbsp ginger paste
* 1 tbsp garlic paste
* 3 medium onions, thinly sliced, fried and ground.
* 2 tsp fried and ground garam masala in a 2:1 ratio. Black pepper and cumin are 2, while cloves and black cardamom seeds are 1. Measure after grinding.
* 2 tbsp poppy seeds (_posta_) ground in a coffee grinder
* ½ cup fried walnuts or almonds
* 2 tbsp roasted gram flour (_bhuna besan_)
* ½ cup neutral oil
* Red chile powder, to taste
* Salt, to taste

# Preparation
Wash and drain ground meat very well. Mix all the ingredient including oil, and let marinate in the fridge overnight. If needed for dinner marinate in the morning.

Grease an ovenproof dish, and pat marinated mixture into it. Cook in 350F for 20 to 25 minutes depending on the oven. Everyone’s oven is different so be careful to not overcook or dry out the kababs.

# Tips
> Gram flour can be replaced with 3 slices of bread soaked in water, squeezed and mashed well.
