# Directions
Peel turai and slice into 1/2" rounds. 

Add kalonji, cumin, fennel, and green chile (optional) to oil on low heat and once they emit their aroma, quickly add onions and increase heat to medium. 

After 2-3 minutes, add ginger and garlic, and fry till onions become light brown.

Add sponge gourd, stir, and add all the spices and salt. Cook covered on low until turai is three quarters done. 

Add tomatoes and coriander, and cook uncovered on medium heat till tomatoes are soft but not completely dry. Turn off stove.

Spoon into a serving dish and garnish with coriander leaves.
