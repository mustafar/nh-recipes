Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 5 kilos Ramkela variety raw mangoes washed and dried well
* 250g fennel seeds (_moti saunf_)
* 50g nigella/onion seeds (_kalonji_)
* 100g fenugreek seeds (_methi_)
* 500g salt (100g per 1kg mango)
* 100g turmeric powder
* 100g mild red chile powder (_kashmiri lal mirch_)
* 750g-1kg chickpeas (_chhola_)
* 3-3½ lt mustard oil
* Large ceramic or glass jar(s), thoroughly washed and dried.
* A clean and dry basin to mix everything in.
* Muslin cloth to tie the top of jar.

# Directions
Cut mangoes into 8 pieces or more. Mix spices with mango pieces in basin, and pour into jars. Top with oil — it should cover all mango pieces. 

Put in the sun for 6-8 weeks. Keep away from rain or any moisture. During this period, change muslin cloth about four times. 

When finally done, put regular lid on top. Periodically keep in the sun. The older the pickle, the better it tastes.

# Tips
> Replace kashmiri lal mirch with regular lal mirch if you want your pickle spicier.
