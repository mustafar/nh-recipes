DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY- MEDIUM

INGREDIENTS 

1 cup basmati rice washed and soaked in water for 30 minutes 

1 cup orange juice(I use fresh) It should not be sour

1/2 cup castor sugar or then measure and grind it if sugar is coarse plus 
2 tablespoons additional

a few cloves

a few green cardamoms

1 tablespoon ghee 

1/4 cup thin strips of orange peel cut like matchsticks and pith scraped off

Take the strips of orange peel with pith(the light yellow part inside the skin), removed, and boil in water. Once it boils for about 2 minutes, throw water away, and repeat 3 more times, a total of four times. These removes the bitter taste. Put strips in a sieve till all water drains away. Next take 2 tablespoons of sugar, and cook strips over a slow fire, till all sugar has melted and strips are nicely coated. The sugar syrup should have become dry by now. Keep aside for garnishing. 

Cook soaked rice covered in pure orange juice carefully on a slow fire. 

Fluff up with a fork. 

In a pot put ghee on a slow fire. Add cloves and cardamom. When cardamom puffs up, add half of the rice. Sprinkle half of the sugar on top, and carefully fold it in. Now add the remaining rice, and again on top the remaining sugar, folding it in. When done, fold entire rice again so itâ€™s ghee coated also. Place in a dish, and garnish with orange strips.
