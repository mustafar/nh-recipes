# Ingredients:
* 300g ound eggplant (_baigan_)
* 250g yogurt
* 100g oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 green chile (_hari mirch_)
* 75g green coriander (_dhania ki patti_)
* Salt, to taste
* ¼ tsp red chile (_lal mirch_) powder
* ½ tsp cumin (_zeera_) powder
* Pinch of black mustard seeds (_rai_)
* Few leaves of sweet neem (_kari patta_)
* 2 whole dry red chiles
      

# Directions
Wash the eggplants and dry. Cut them into thick round slices. 

Place the slices on a skillet. Drop some oil around the slices and let cook on a slow flame. When tender and brown, flip the slices and cook the other side. For 300g, you will either need two skillets or cook the slices in two batches.

Now remove the skin from around the slices. Mash with a spoon and add salt, chile and cumin powder. Now add the chopped onions and greens.

Refrigerate till you are ready to serve. Bring to room temperature and fold in the whisked yogurt. Stir carefully. If the yoghurt is too thick whisk in 1-  tbsps of milk before adding to the eggplant.

In a fry pan prepare the seasoning – some oil, a pinch of black mustard seeds, a few leaves of sweet neem and two dry red chiles.

Season the dish and enjoy it with multigrain or plain roti.
