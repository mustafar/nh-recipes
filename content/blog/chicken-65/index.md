Deep fry chicken pieces in oil on medium flame. Poke fork or knife to see if done. Remove and drain on paper towel.

Mix all the yogurt ingredients except curry leaves and slit green chillies, and keep aside.

In an broad and open pan, heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil. Add about 20 curry leaves and 6-7 slit green chillies. As they begin to splutter add the yoghurt mix.
