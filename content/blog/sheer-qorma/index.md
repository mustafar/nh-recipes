Servings: 15-20  
Difficulty: Medium  

# Ingredients
* 5 litres full fat milk
* 100g rice (any variety, I use basmati) soaked then ground till it feels grainy
* 375g sugar
* 125g roasted Benarsi sewain
* Fistful of unsalted pistachios, soaked and slivered
* Fistful of unsalted almonds, soaked, peeled and slivered
* Ghee
* Big pinch of saffron (_zafran_)
* 1 tsp ground cardamom (_elaichi_)
* 2 tsp kewra (optional)

# Preparation

Put up room temperature milk to boil along with ground rice with saffron and ground cardamom on medium-high to high heat. Add more later if you think cardamom is not enough. Stir continuously till rice is cooked. You should be able to mush it with your fingers.

Now add sugar, and keep stirring. Soon, the milk will start thickening. This is by experience that you get to know, but when you see the change, take out a spoon in a little bowl, and let cool. You will be able to judge it's consistency. Turn heat down to low.

In a tbsp of ghee, fry the sewain on low to medium heat, being very attentive. When a nice aroma wafts through the air, be careful not to overdo it, quickly put it in the milk. Raise heat to medium, and let it cook till done, again, testing it between your fingers. Switch off stove.

In a tbsp of ghee, fry pistachios over low heat and when done, pour over sheer. Save some ghee for the almonds, and fry separately. Pour over sheer also. Both should be lightly fried, golden.
