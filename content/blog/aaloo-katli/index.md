Difficulty: Easy

# Ingredients
* 4-5 medium sized potatoes
* 2 medium sized tomatoes
* 3-4 red chiles (_lal mirch_)
* 2-3 green chiles (_hari mirch_)
* 1 tsp cumin (_zeera_) seeds
* Â¼ tsp turmeric powder (_haldi_)
* One pinch hing
* Salt, to taste
* Coriander (_dhania_) leaves, to garnish
* Mustard oil, for frying

# Directions
Heat mustard oil, enough to fry potatoes. Add 4-5 thick-cut, round medium sized potatoes. Fry well for 8-9 minutes. Remove fried potatoes from oil (they should be tender but not mushy) and keep aside.

Remove excess oil if required and fry 3-4 whole red chiles. Remove and set aside. Then in the same oil add 1 tsp zeera and a pinch of hing. Also add around 2 finely diced tomatoes, stir then add 2-3 broken green chiles. Add salt as per taste, stir, and add little haldi.

Crush the fried red chiles and add them as well. Then add little water (maybe 200ml; these potatoes are served dry). Stir well then add fried potaties. Gently mix with cooked masala. The potatoes are already almost cooked, so just cover and cook for 2 minutes.

Garnish with chopped coriander leavers and sliced green chiles, and serve.
